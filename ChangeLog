    * create package

2013-08-14  
    * add set.seed(1) to chngpt.score.test so that the results are
    reproducible
    * rename chngpt.score.test to chngpt.test
    * MASS is used for generating reference distribution samples while mvrnorm
    is used in sim.sigmoid. In principle, should be able to use a single
    package, but since the simulation studies for the paper has already been
    run, just leave it as it is
    * let search.all.thresholds be true if n < 500

2015-09-01  
    * when glm warns, set the log likelihood to NA

2015-10-18  
    * when est.method==smoothapprox, effective chgnpt needs to be determined
    to stop infinite loops. It used to be defined in between two observed data
    values, but is not set to one observed data value

2015-11-19  
    * make.chngpt.var now takes b. as an argument, the results of smoothapprox

2018-03-30  
    * change how chngpts are defined in chngpt.test
    * weighted estimation now works
    * chngptm used to use chngpt.test to initialize when doing smooth
    approximation. now chngptm uses chngptm to initialize in that situation.
    This way chngptm does not depend on chngpt.test anymore

2018-05-02  
    * Add support for cbind() on the lhs for the binomial family. Both grid
    and smoothapprox are supported.

2018-07-25

2019-04-21
    * Discovered that adding support for thinned thresholds back in 2018-10-2
    (compared to 2018-10-1) slows things down by two fold. Fixed it.

2019-06-17
    * This version has an unsuccesful attempt to add upper hinge quadratic
    model   

2019-06-17

2019-08-26
    * chngpt.test throws an exception. Modify chngpt.test() to check if the min and max are part of the candidate change points and if yes, remove them. Thanks to Eric Scott for the question resulting in the update

2019-08-28
    * Remove fastgrid_binomial_wrapper.cpp and fastgrid_binomial.cpp for now. They lead to check errors on CRAN. Namespace and description file also changed accordingly

    * implement fastgrid2 for step

2019-10-17
