2013-05-25  V_0.1-1 Youyi Fong

    * create package

2013-08-14  V_0.1-2 Youyi Fong

    * add set.seed(1) to chngpt.score.test so that the results are
    reproducible
    * rename chngpt.score.test to chngpt.test
    * MASS is used for generating reference distribution samples while mvrnorm
    is used in sim.sigmoid. In principle, should be able to use a single
    package, but since the simulation studies for the paper has already been
    run, just leave it as it is
    * let search.all.thresholds be true if n < 500

2015-09-01  Youyi Fong

    * when glm warns, set the log likelihood to NA

2015-09-29  Youyi Fong

    * implement more vcov
    * add e.effective.maxit to deal with non-convergence
    
2015-10-18  Youyi Fong

    * when est.method==smoothapprox, effective chgnpt needs to be determined
    to stop infinite loops. It used to be defined in between two observed data
    values, but is not set to one observed data value

    * make.chngpt.var now takes b. as an argument, the results of smoothapprox
    estimation will change!

2016-01-24  Youyi Fong

    * add testing for linear model

2017-05-13  Youyi Fong

    * modify make.chngpt.var to fit smooth transition model
    * add sandwich variance estimator
    * add segmented2
    * change b to -b

2017-09-16  Youyi Fong

    * this version contains some commented out code related to indices, which
    was used to compare with R implemention

2017-10-27  Youyi Fong

    * a major cleanup of sim.chngpt
	* weighted estimation now works

2018-03-30  Youyi Fong

    * change how chngpts are defined in chngpt.test
	* weighted estimation now works
	* chngptm used to use chngpt.test to initialize when doing smooth
	approximation. now chngptm uses chngptm to initialize in that situation.
	This way chngptm does not depend on chngpt.test anymore

2018-05-02  Youyi Fong
	* Add support for cbind() on the lhs for the binomial family. Both grid
	and smoothapprox are supported.
	* Add support for Poisson family

2018-06-02
	* Implement fastgrid for thinned thresholds. 
	* Deprecate useC for grid search
	* Revamp vignette
	* Add approximate p value when var.method is bootstrap
	* Change summary chngptm output to remove empirical percentile of the
	estimated threshold

2018-07-02
	* Add chngptm.xy (x,y,...) to provide an alternative way of fitting
	chngptm without data frame and formula

2018-07-16
	* Replace %+% by %.% throughout	

2018-07-25
	* Change robust testing implementation
	* RDR is changed to R.h %*% D.h when not robust. This requires a change of
	values in the unit testing function

2018-08-07
	* Add upper hinge model implementation
	* Remove smooth as a var.type, comment out var.est.smooth and remove
	smooth from unit testing
	* Implement superfastgrid
	* Merge fastgrid_search and boot_fastgrid_search into one C function
	* Implement grid search in C for upperhinge2

2018-10-08
	* A naive implementation of the test inversion CI is added when search method is grid

2019-01-02	
	* Michal Jurask reported a bug when the glm has a NA coef. Fix at line
	897.

2019-03-08
	* Bug fix, delete to delete[]
