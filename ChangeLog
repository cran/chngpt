2013-05-25  V_0.1-1 Youyi Fong

    * create package

2013-08-14  V_0.1-2 Youyi Fong

    * add set.seed(1) to chngpt.score.test so that the results are
    reproducible
    * rename chngpt.score.test to chngpt.test
    * MASS is used for generating reference distribution samples while mvrnorm
    is used in sim.sigmoid. In principle, should be able to use a single
    package, but since the simulation studies for the paper has already been
    run, just leave it as it is
    * let search.all.thresholds be true if n < 500

2015-09-01  Youyi Fong

    * when glm warns, set the log likelihood to NA

2015-09-29  Youyi Fong

    * implement more vcov
    * add e.effective.maxit to deal with non-convergence
    
2015-10-18  Youyi Fong

    * when est.method==smoothapprox, effective chgnpt needs to be determined
    to stop infinite loops. It used to be defined in between two observed data
    values, but is not set to one observed data value

2015-11-19  Youyi Fong

    * make.chngpt.var now takes b. as an argument, the results of smoothapprox
    estimation will change!

2016-01-24  Youyi Fong

    * add testing for linear model

2017-05-13  Youyi Fong

    * modify make.chngpt.var to fit smooth transition model
    * add sandwich variance estimator
    * add segmented2
    * change b to -b

2017-09-16  Youyi Fong

    * this version contains some commented out code related to indices, which
    was used to compare with R implemention

2017-10-27  Youyi Fong

    * a major cleanup of sim.chngpt
    * weighted estimation now works

2018-03-30  Youyi Fong

    * change how chngpts are defined in chngpt.test
    * weighted estimation now works
    * chngptm used to use chngpt.test to initialize when doing smooth
    approximation. now chngptm uses chngptm to initialize in that situation.
    This way chngptm does not depend on chngpt.test anymore

2018-05-02  Youyi Fong
    * Add support for cbind() on the lhs for the binomial family. Both grid
    and smoothapprox are supported.
    * Add support for Poisson family

2018-06-02
    * Implement fastgrid for thinned thresholds. 
    * Deprecate useC for grid search
    * Revamp vignette
    * Add approximate p value when var.method is bootstrap
    * Change summary chngptm output to remove empirical percentile of the
    estimated threshold

2018-07-02
    * Add chngptm.xy (x,y,...) to provide an alternative way of fitting
    chngptm without data frame and formula

2018-07-16
    * Replace %+% by %.% throughout 

2018-07-25
    * Change robust testing implementation
    * RDR is changed to R.h %*% D.h when not robust. This requires a change of
    values in the unit testing function

2018-08-07
    * Add upper hinge model implementation
    * Remove smooth as a var.type, comment out var.est.smooth and remove
    smooth from unit testing
    * Implement superfastgrid
    * Merge fastgrid_search and boot_fastgrid_search into one C function
    * Implement grid search in C for upperhinge2

2018-10-08
    * A naive implementation of the test inversion CI is added when search method is grid

2019-01-02  
    * Michal Jurask reported a bug when the glm has a NA coef. Fix at line
    897.

2019-03-08
    * Bug fix, delete to delete[]

2019-03-12
    * Bug fix, add   X.col(p-2) = (x-e)%(x>e); in fastgrid_binomial.cpp

2019-04
    * Fix vcov implementation when var.type is bootstrap
    * Add multicore parallel support for bootstrap. ncpus controls the number of cores. Thanks to JDS for the question resulting in this change

2019-04-21
    * Discovered that adding support for thinned thresholds back in 2018-10-2
    (compared to 2018-10-1) slows things down by two fold. Fixed it.

2019-06-17
    * This version has an unsuccesful attempt to add upper hinge quadratic
    model   

2019-06-17
    * Revert back to before 6.17

2019-06-30
    * Revert back to 6.17 and work from there
    * Change the implementation of upperhingequad in chngptm from based on formula.2 to type

2019-07-23
    * Bug fix in SEXP fastgrid2quad_gaussian so that bootstrap for upperhingequad works too

2019-08-16
    * Allow subsampling bootstrap m-out-of-n for discontinuous threshold effects in chngptm(). Thanks to Jeremy Nguyen for the question resulting in this change

2019-08-17
    * Allow more than one variables to be interacting with the threshold variable. chngptm updated, unit testing code added. A quick test for consistency performed (test_multi_itxn.R). Thanks to Jeremy Nguyen for the question resulting in this change

2019-08-26
    * chngpt.test throws an exception. Modify chngpt.test() to check if the min and max are part of the candidate change points and if yes, remove them. Thanks to Eric Scott for the question resulting in this change
    * Add CXX_STD = CXX11 to Makevars and Makevars.win. Replace ptr_fun by cref in smath.h. Thanks Prof Brian Ripley
    * Change ncpus default to 1 to avoid an error on debian

2019-08-28
    * Remove fastgrid_binomial_wrapper.cpp and fastgrid_binomial.cpp for now. They lead to check errors on CRAN. Namespace and description file also changed accordingly
    * Vignette updated
